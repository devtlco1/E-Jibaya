  # Fix RLS policies for user creation

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop existing problematic policies on users table
    - Create new policies that work with session-based authentication
    - Allow admin users to create new users based on session validation
    - Maintain security while preventing policy violations

  2. Policy Structure
    - Simple policies that don't cause recursion
    - Session-based validation instead of JWT claims
    - Proper INSERT permissions for admin users
